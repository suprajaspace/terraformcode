Providers are a logical abstraction of an upstream API. They are responsible for understanding API interactions and exposing resources.
Providers must be defined in Terraform configuration file (.tf) to specify which service interacting with (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, etc.).

EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instance in AWS is a virtual server that allows you to run applications in the cloud.

Security groups act as virtual firewalls for your EC2 instances to control inbound and outbound traffic.

## EC2 Instance creation

provider.tf 

here provider.tf added here to connection between AWS and terraform  

for reference: 

https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs

terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "5.66.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  # Configuration options
  region = "us-east-1"
}


configuration options :
AWS access key id, secret access key id configured in AWS CLI

ec2.tf

here ec2.tf added to create ec2 instance and security group

for reference :

https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/instance

resource "aws_instance" "terraform" {
  ami = "ami-09c813fb71547fc4f"
  instance_type = "t3.micro"
  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.allow_ssh_terraform.id]
  tags ={
    Name = "terraform"
  }
  }

resource "resource name" "name of resource "

ami is the AMI ID of RHEL-9 DevOps-Practice.
* EC2 > AMIs > search with devops-practice 

instance-type: required Instance type

vpc_security_group_ids : using Key pair name, here using allow_ssh_terraform id of aws_security_group

tags block is used to give name and tags of the resources.
here Name is for Name of the instance

#### security group :

here security group provide for to create ec2 instance

for reference:

https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/security_group
```
resource "aws_security_group" "allow_ssh_terraform" {
    name        = "allow_sshh" 
    description = "Allow port number 22 for SSH access"

    #usually we allow everything in egress

    egress {
        from_port        = 0
        to_port          = 0
        protocol         = "-1"
        cidr_blocks      = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
        ipv6_cidr_blocks = ["::/0"]
    }

    ingress {
        from_port        = 22
        to_port          = 22
        protocol         = "tcp"
        cidr_blocks      = ["0.0.0.0/0"] #allow from everyone
        ipv6_cidr_blocks = ["::/0"]
    }

    tags = {
    Name = "allow_sshh"
  }
}
 ```
 resource "resourse name" "name of resource"

 name is for "security group name" 

 description is information about this security group

egress block:
Egress rules are applied to control the outbound traffic from an instance or service. By default, AWS allows all outbound traffic unless you specify otherwise.

Ingress block:
Ingress rules to specify what traffic is allowed to access your instance.

tags block is used to Name of the security groups.

* here 2 different names , one is for "Name" which is under tags, one is for "security group name"
